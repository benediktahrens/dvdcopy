h1. dvdcopy: backup your DVDs to disk

This program copies the contents of video DVDs to disk using
libdvdread. This means it can benefit of the present of libdvdcss on
your computer.

This program was designed as a means to view DVDs from public
libraries, as those are too scratched to be viewed directly with
DVD-playing software such as xine, and must be copied to hard disk
first.

h2. Installation instructions

Make sure you have the @dvdread@ development files installed first,
which on Debian based distros such as Ubuntu is just a matter of running:

<pre>
% sudo apt-get install libdvdread-dev
</pre>

Then, unpack the tarball and run

<pre>
% ./configure
% make 
% sudo make install
</pre>

That should get you running.


h2. Use

Typical use:

<pre>
% dvdcopy /dev/dvd Movie
</pre>

This copies the contents of the video DVD @/dev/dvd@ into the
directory @Movie@. Most video-playing softwares can play DVDs directly
in directories. For instance, with xine, you would use:

<pre>
% xine dvd://`pwd`/Movie
</pre>

h2. Caveats

@dvdcopy@ won't work on devices you don't have read access to. On
Debian systems, this usually means you need to be member of the
@cdrom@ group.
