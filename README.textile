h1. dvdcopy: backup your DVDs to disk

This program copies the contents of video DVDs to disk using
libdvdread. This means it can benefit of the present of libdvdcss on
your computer.

This program was designed as a means to view DVDs from public
libraries, as those are too scratched to be viewed directly with
DVD-playing software such as xine, and must be copied to hard disk
first.

Typical use:

<pre>
% dvdcopy /dev/dvd Movie
</pre>

This copies the contents of the video DVD @/dev/dvd@ into the
directory @Movie@. Most video-playing softwares can play DVDs directly
in directories. For instance, with xine, you would use:

<pre>
% xine dvd://`pwd`/Movie
</pre>
