Description:  bad-sectors resistant DVD-to-disc command-line program
 This program copies the contents of video DVDs to disk using
 libdvdread. This means it can benefit of the present of libdvdcss on
 your computer.
 .
 This program was designed as a means to view DVDs from public
 libraries, as those are too scratched to be viewed directly with
 DVD-playing software such as xine, and must be copied to hard disk
 first.
